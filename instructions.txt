Poetry Setup Instructions
=========================

Starting with pyproject.toml file:

1. Install Poetry:
   powershell -c "(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -"

2. Configure Poetry to create venv in project:
   poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

3. Update lock file and install:
   poetry lock
   poetry install

4. Select Python interpreter in VS Code:
   a.    Ctrl+Shift+P → "Python: Select Interpreter" → Choose the .venv one
   b.    Done. You can now run Python files normally.

Alternative: Use poetry run python your_script.py if needed.

Adding new packages:
poetry add package-name
(No need for lock/install - poetry add does it automatically)
